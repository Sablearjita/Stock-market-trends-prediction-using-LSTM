# Stock Market Trends Prediction using LSTM:

This repository contains code for predicting stock market trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The data for training and testing the model is fetched from Yahoo Finance.

# Overview:

In this project, we utilize LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for predicting stock market trends. LSTM networks are well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to their ability to remember information over long periods. We fetch historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, preprocess it, and train an LSTM model to predict future trends.

# Requirements:

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

Python (>= 3.6)
TensorFlow (>= 2.0)
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)

# Files:

Project.py - contains the code to build the python web app with streamlit 
Stocks_final.ipynb- contains the code to build and train the lstm model to predict the stock prices of different stocks available on yahoo finance website. 

# Implementation:
